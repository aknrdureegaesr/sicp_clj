Fine thinking - works if programmer laziness is to be valued
and infinite precision integer multiplication is at hand.

Actually using an infinite precision integer multiplication
would counteract the performance boost we want to see from that test.

Typical finite precision math (such as Java's long)
wraps around at 2^something silently, without any indication
that anything is wrong. Which it is.

The test will work fine for very small numbers,
as long as the power still fits into Java's long
(or into whatever finite precision type is used),
but produce garbage for bigger numbers.
