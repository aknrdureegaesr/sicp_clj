I didn't actually do this exercise,
but I would expect the advantage of fewer divisions
to be eaten up by the added complexity of the test,
plus the call of the next function.

I think it entirely feasible that the "improved" version
might end up running slower.

It might be mildly interesting to see whether lazy sequences
rescue this situation.

Maybe I end up missing some good fun here,
but as I write this, I decide to be not sufficiently interested
in such low-level optimization stuff to actually do it.

(I speculate the point of that exercise may be
to point out the dangers of such low-level optimization stuff.)
