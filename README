Some of the [Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)
exercises in Clojure.

This is not a particular efficient way to learn
Clojure.  You can give it a try if you want to,
but don't say I recommended it.

I did this for a while, until something even more
interesting demanded my attention.  Wasn't very
long - I never made it past chapter 1.

I don't really think there is any material
available here that is all that usefull or
interesting for anyone.  The time measurement
results in
[AnswerToExercise_1_22.clj](chapter1/src/chapter1/AnswerToExercise_1_22.clj)
may be an exception, persumably showing the Java
JIT in action.
