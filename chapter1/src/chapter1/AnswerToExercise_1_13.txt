I won't actually do that exercise,
as I have studied those sequences quite well years ago.

Indeed, I found one can use Fibonacci-like sequences
as yet another way of calculating sqrt(A), for positive numbers A.

Here are the details:

If you have any positive number A and you would like to calculate sqrt(A),
you start with any positive number G that is a guess for sqrt(A).
(In theory, it need not even be close, though in practice, the closer,
the better.)

Background:> Now consider the polynomal
Background:> 
Background:> p(x) = (x - G - sqrt(A)) * (x - G + sqrt(A))
Background:>      = x² - 2 G x + G² - A
Background:> 
Background:> It has the roots x_0 = G + sqrt(A) and x_1 = G - sqrt(A).
Background:> 
Background:> In other words, those two numbers solve
Background:> 
Background:>    x² = 2 G  + A - G²
Background:>

Now consider sequences f_n of positive numbers 
such that

   f_(n+1) = 2 * G * f_n + (A - G²) * f_(n-1)

Background:> The sequence X1 given by 1, x_1, x_1², x_1³, ... is one such.
Background:> As is the sequence X2 given by 1, x_2, x_2², x_2³, ... .

Out of these, we will consider the sequence Y that starts
with 1, 1.

Then Y_(n+1) / Y_n will converge to G + sqrt(A)
unless you happened to precisely choose G = sqrt(A) + 1,
in which case the sequence will come out constant 1.

Those fractions give you approximations of G + sqrt(A),
and hence, by subtracting G, of sqrt(A).

Example:

A = 10, G = 3,

f_(n+1) = 6 * f_n + f_(n-1)

The sequence is

1, 1, 7, 43, 265, 1633

1633 / 265 - 3 = 838 / 265
Test: (838 / 265)² = 10 - 6 / 70225

In another variation of the sqrt- theme, you could use an approximation
produced by one Fibonacci-like sequence as the G for the next one.
