I'm not doing this exercise.

Instead, I have done some experiments with yet another strategy
in the iterate directory.

That strategy is:

* Do some mathematical analysis as to the behaviour of the sequence of guesses.

* Analysis result:
  In the cases of interest here, the next guess will always be lower
  than the previous one. They are all larger than the number they
  aim to approximate, though the difference decreases.

* In finite precision arithmetic, no sequence of numbers can fall forever.

* When the limit of precision is reached, subsequent guesses
  will remain constant, or may even rise ever so slightly.

* Monitor the behavior of the guesses sequence and stop producing
  further guesses when the guesses no longer fall.

This is guaranteed to produce the maximum precision available.

What precision could be obtained has been tested empirically.

In the cube root case, the precision was slightly better than
that obtained from Math.pow
